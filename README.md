##What is this project?

The goal of this project is to promote government open data by designing clever uses for government APIs. 

##Who should help?

Anyone! Any level of tech skill can contribute to this project. You might be interested in joining if you want to learn more about APIs or government open data.

##How can I get involved?

Start by checking out the tool this idea is based on [If This Then That](http://ifttt.com). IFTTT uses some jargon that I'll be using, including trigger, action, and recipes.

Then, once you understand the idea, you can contribute in a couple ways:

* __Get Creative__: You could start by just brainstorming government services and how they might fit into a recipe. Perhaps browsing through [IFTTT recipes](https://ifttt.com/recipes) or [government APIs](http://catalog.data.gov/dataset?res_format=api)  could jumpstart your creativity.
* __Find Useful Gov Data__: Look through [this list of government APIs](http://catalog.data.gov/dataset?res_format=api) for data in the APIs that could be useful for this project. Add your idea and a link to the feed in the list below.
* __Help Organize__: You could help by organizing the list below.
*__Learn more about APIs__: You can learn more about APIs on [Code Academy](http://codeacademy.org). (Any other good recommendations?)

I'll be working on this at [Code for DC](http://codefordc.org).

##Brainstorming

* if census releases economic indicator above/below something
* government status changes (opm.gov/status)
* USAJobs, FOIA, Federal Register keywords come up
* CPSC recalls - Jed Sundwall
* New entries on regulations.gov - @alandelevie
* TSA security line wait times reach a certain time
* I would say 'farmers market opens for the year' but think that the metadata for that API isn't parsed out well enough for that.  - @gbinal
* I wonder if it'd be possible to use the NREL API to power something that would alert you whenever there's a new alternative fuel station that opens within a certain geographic area... - @gbinal
* Maybe airport status (not quite the same as line times)?  E.G.  Triggers that are based off of an airport getting shut down.  I feel like many frequent flyers would be interested in getting a heads up of an event like this morning's at LAX for any airport in the lower 48, not just certain ones.  - @gbinal
* A we the people petition passes x number of signatures, includes x keywords
* "I had always envisioned agencies pushing each of their posts from any platform into an open Google Calendar so they can better see the spread of coverage between their sub-agencies, etc, and there would also be an easy to evaluate record for the public." - Justin Herman
* Do a "cook-off"/hackathon w/ fed devs and IFTTT folks - @erie
* If Natural Disaster (per NOAA) then Resources (localized per GPS) (FEMA) + (CDC) + (HHS) + (Coast Guard) + (National Guard) @hobokenmartha
* Link to Google Docs / Dropbox so that APIs with information can be downloaded easily and tracked by people who may have uses for them that we can't think of. - @mkramer
* Connect all projects to Google Drive or Dropbox for people to collect information for future projects that we might not be aware of yet. (i.e. information about clinical trials, etc.) - @mkramer
 * If natural disaster happens, publish data from National Map: http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/the-national-map - @mkramer
 * If a certain person or organization visits the White House (use White House visitor log API) notify me by email/tweet it/etc. - @mkramer

logistics/questions
--

* Start by turning triggers into RSS feeds and promoting IFTTT recipes with them? Popular (albeit pointless) example: Text me when CDC reports a Zombie outbreak https://ifttt.com/recipes/48155
* GSA is working with IFTTT now... updates appreciated...
* Research YQL and Yahoo Pipes
* https://www.finally.io/
